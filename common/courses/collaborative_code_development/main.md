## Part 1: Why software needs collaboration

---
layout: two-cols

# Software development is ongoing

- Software is never "finished"
- Bugs are discovered over time
- New requirements and improvements emerge

# Knowing about problems is not enough

- Issues must be recorded somewhere shared
- They need prioritisation and ownership
- Decisions need context and history
- That is what **issue tracking** provides:
  - A shared list of tasks, bugs, and ideas
  - A place for discussion and decisions
  - A record of what was done and why

## Part 2: Platforms enable these practices

# From collaboration practices to tools

- Issue tracking is a practice
- Parallel work is a practice
- Code review is a practice

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <h3><b>Tools exist to support these practices at scale</b></h3>
</div>

# Collaborating without platforms

Email patches on mailing lists.

- Run `diff` against a known version, paste output into an email
- Maintainers apply the patch manually (`git am`)
- Still used today:
  - the Linux kernel
  - Git
  - PostgreSQL

# Why do we focus on GitHub

- **Hosting + issues + forks + PRs in one platform** --- earlier tools
  (gitweb, cgit, Gitorious) were either browse-only or single-feature
- **Free repositories** --- no cost barrier for a first project
- **Community adoption** --- once it gained traction from the open-source community, the momentum continues
- Alternatives:
  - GitLab (GNOME, freedesktop.org)
  - Codeberg (Zig, from Nov 2025)

# Project management with GitHub

- "GitHub Issues" are an implementation of issue tracking
- "Mentions" are a communication mechanism
- "Labels" categorise issues
- "Milestones" group issues/PRs with a common goal (e.g. a release)

# Git branches enable parallel workflows

::center

**Git implements parallel work using branches.**

<br />

<div style="width: 70%;">
```mermaid
gitGraph
  commit id: "A"
  branch develop
  commit id: "B"
  branch big_feature
  commit id: "C"
  checkout develop
  commit id: "D"
  checkout main
  merge develop tag: "v1.1"
  checkout develop
  branch small_feature
  commit id: "E"
  commit id: "F"
  checkout big_feature
  commit id: "G"
  checkout develop
  merge small_feature
  checkout main
  merge develop tag: "v1.2"
  checkout big_feature
  commit id: "H"
```
</div>

# Git branches + feature branch workflow

<div class="flex flex-1 items-end justify-between h-64 w-100%">

<div class="flex flex-col justify-between items-center w-45 h-100% text-sm">
Commit to main branch
```mermaid {scale: 0.8}
gitGraph BT:
  commit id: "First"
  commit id: "Second"
```
</div>

<div v-click class="flex flex-col justify-between items-center w-45 h-100% text-sm">
Create a new branch, make commits to it
```mermaid {scale: 0.8}
gitGraph BT:
  commit id: "First"
  commit id: "Second"
  branch feature
  commit id: "New thing"
```
</div>

<div v-click class="flex flex-col justify-between items-center w-45 h-100% text-sm">
Changes independent of main branch
```mermaid {scale: 0.8}
gitGraph BT:
  commit id: "First"
  commit id: "Second"
  branch feature
  commit id: "New thing"
  checkout main
  commit id: "Other work"
```
</div>

<div v-click class="flex flex-col justify-between items-center w-45 h-100% text-sm">
Merge commit
```mermaid {scale: 0.8}
gitGraph BT:
  commit id: "First"
  commit id: "Second"
  branch feature
  commit id: "New thing"
  checkout main
  commit id: "Other work"
  merge feature
```
</div>

</div>

- Main branch for tested, stable code, feature branches for new, separate units of work
- Keeps main branch stable, allows independent work on features
- Easy to discard unwanted features

# Adding code via GitHub pull requests

- Discuss and review changes
- Add follow-up commits based on feedback
- Merge changes from feature branch to base branch

# There's more to GitHub

- **GitHub Pages**: publish a project website straight from a repository
  - Great for documentation and small project sites
- **GitHub Releases**: tag a commit, attach build artefacts, write
  release notes --- a permanent versioned snapshot
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD that runs on every push or PR
- **Draft pull requests**: share work-in-progress without it being treated as
  ready to merge
- **Branch protection**: block direct pushes to `main`, require reviews before
  merge
- **Sub-issues, issue types, GitHub Projects**: issue tracking with more
  structure
- **GitHub Discussions**: questions, ideas, networking

# Be a helpful and nice person!

- **Search before posting** --- your problem may already be reported.
- **Read the contribution guidelines**
- **Write clear bug reports**
  - what you ran
  - what happened
  - what you expected
  - the version you were on
  - with a minimal example to demonstrate the bug
- **Tone matters**: the people on the other side are real people!
- **AI usage**: do not inundate people with AI-generated issues/feature
  requests

# Learning objectives

- Use the feature branch workflow to collaborate with others on the same repository
- Learn about code reviews and pull requests on GitHub
- Understand and create GitHub issues to manage bug reports and feature requests
