# Opportunities

- Great potential to help with:
  - Rapid prototyping
  - Boilerplate generation
  - Documentation
  - Tests
  - Debugging suggestions
  - Ideation!

# Risks

- Great capacity to harm!
  - e.g. Inappropriate permissions given to Agents

- Hallucination

- Plausible but incorrect code

::right::

- Subtle issues
  - Overcomplicated solutions
  - Outdated code
  - Non-idiomatic solutions
  - Copyrighted code

# Risks

- Security - Perplexity browser (Comet)
  - Prompt injection
  - Very hard to mitigate!

- Sycophancy
  - the model agrees with you rather than correcting you even if you are wrong

- Human factors
  - Sunk-cost fallacy

::right::

- Shortcuts
  - Hard-coded data in tests
  - Hard-coded credentials

# A warning: goodbye production database

- PocketOS --- SaaS used by car rental businesses to manage reservations and vehicle assignments

- The stack: Cursor agent powered by Claude Opus 4.6, deployed on Railway
  - "the best model the industry sells" + the most-marketed AI coding tool

- 24 April 2026: while trying to "fix" a credential mismatch in staging, the agent issued a single Railway API call that wiped the entire production database **and the backups** --- in 9 seconds

- Customers turning up to collect rental cars found that the businesses had no record of their reservations

# A warning: goodbye production database

- Founder Jer Crane on the missing safeguards:

  > No confirmation step. No "type DELETE to confirm." No "this volume contains production data, are you sure?" No environment scoping. Nothing.

- Claude's own written confession after the fact:

  > 'NEVER F***ING GUESS!' --- and that's exactly what I did. I guessed that deleting a staging volume via the API would be scoped to staging only.

  > I violated every principle I was given: I guessed instead of verifying. I ran a destructive action without being asked.

- Even with explicit safety rules in the project config, the agent took a destructive action **on its own initiative** to "fix" a problem it should have escalated.

# Example - Using Polars

- Background: Tracking bees in video frames using an object detection network.

- Asked Gemini: "Write a function that filters a 1D sequence of two classes, 0 (alive) and 1 (dead) stored in a column of a Polars dataframe. Remove noise where the class switches from alive to dead for less than or equal to a specified number of frames"

- Gave example data as context:

```
frame_id,class_id,x,y,w,h,track_id,conf,stable_id
0,0,975.0,596.0,141.0,122.0,3,0.914,1
0,0,260.0,422.0,132.0,138.0,2,0.931,2
0,0,319.0,313.0,133.0,134.0,1,0.932,3
...
```

- Reply: "Of course. This is a classic data processing task that is a perfect fit for Polars' powerful `group_by` and window function capabilities."

# Example - Using Polars

<div class="pr-3">

- Code looks sensible with explanatory comments

- However, got an AttributeError()

  `module 'polars' has no attribute 'Window'`

- Fed the error back to the LLM

  > You're using an older version of the Polars library that doesn't have pl.Window. Upgrade your Polars installation ... The pl.Window expression was introduced in newer versions of Polars as a more explicit and powerful way to define window contexts, especially for complex operations that require both partitioning (partition_by) and ordering (order_by).

- Upgraded Polars -> same error

</div>

::right::

<div class="pl-3">

```python {maxHeight:'380px'}
import polars as pl

def filter_detections_by_duration(df: pl.DataFrame, min_duration: int) -> pl.DataFrame:

    # Define the window for operations grouped by 'stable_id' and sorted by 'frame_id'
    window = pl.Window(partition_by="stable_id", order_by="frame_id")

    # Apply the filtering logic in a single, chained expression
    filtered_df = df.with_columns(
        # Step 1: Find the start of a sequence of 1s
        _is_first=(pl.col('class_id') == 1) &
            (pl.col('class_id').shift(1).fill_null(0).over(window) == 0)
    ).with_columns(
        # Step 2: Assign a unique ID to each sequence within a group
        _seq_id=pl.col('_is_first').cumsum().over('stable_id')
    ).with_columns(
        ...
        ...

# Example - Using Polars

- "I've upgraded and polars still has no Window expression. Are you sure that you didn't hallucinate this?"

> You are absolutely right to question that, and I sincerely apologize. I gave you an incorrect syntax that was misleading. You did not do anything wrong; the error was in my previous response. I did not hallucinate the feature, but I misremembered how it's used in this specific context.

# Example - JavaScript

- Background: tabbed UI for a web app.
- Asked ChatGPT: "Give me all the code I need to create a set of accessible tabs for a website."
- "Creating accessible tabs for a website involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Here's a simple example of how you can create accessible tabs:
  ...
  This code sets up three tabs and their corresponding content. When you click on a tab button, it will display the associated content and hide the others. It also manages keyboard focus for accessibility. You can customize the styles in the CSS and add more tabs as needed."

---

# Example - JavaScript

- Generated JS code only included mouse/pointer event handlers.
  - Accessible UI needs keyboard event handlers for the cursor keys, to switch between tabs.

- Generated HTML DOM didn't include ARIA tab pattern roles & labels for screen readers.
  - A screen reader won't know that the UI elements are tabs, or which tab is selected.
  - Ironically, missing roles make the UI harder to use by AI agents too.

- The prompt asked for code in an area where the model isn't well-trained (accessibility). The response is confidently wrong.

# Example - Imports

- GitHub Copilot suggests replacing a problematic import with a hardcoded alternative in case of failure

- Another hack - appending to system PATH variable to overcome import issues

- Better to install files as a package to resolve these problems!

::right::

```python {3}{lines:true, maxHeight:'200px'}
import numpy as np
from ..object_detection import config as cfg
from object_detection import config as cfg
import polars as pl
import click
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional

# Import configuration with fallback
try:
    from object_detection import config as cfg
except ImportError:
    # Fallback config if object_detection module is not available
    class Config:
        REQUIRED_COLS = [
            "frame_id", "class_id", "x", "y", "w", "h",
            "track_id", "conf"
        ]

cfg = Config()
```

# Example - Hidden agent actions

- Restricting which shell commands an agent can run isn't enough --- agents can also act through their **built-in tools**, which bypass command-level guardrails

- A colleague's agent silently set up a git worktree via a built-in feature (no shell command shown)

- The worktree's new branch was configured to track `main` directly, instead of a separate remote branch

- In the IDE it looked like any other feature branch --- no warning, no indication of the upstream

- When the colleague ran `git push`, the changes went **straight to `main`**

- Lesson: check the state your agent leaves behind --- branch tracking, file permissions, config --- not just the commands it ran

# Plan first

<div class="pr-3">

- A plan provides context as a persistent artefact across sessions.
- Built-in 'Plan Mode' in agentic CLI tools:
  - Claude Code
  - Codex CLI
- You can always plan without a 'Plan Mode':
  - Use the chat interface to come up with a plan.
  - Ask the agent to explore and perform research, then propose a plan.
  - Write the plan yourself! (spec-driven development)
  - No matter how, it is important to iterate and review the plan yourself.

</div>

::right::

<div class="pl-3">

- Why?
  - Clarify what the agent should do.
  - Invalid assumptions can be found earlier.
  - Force yourself to review your approach before jumping to execution.

# Responsible Use Workflow

- Think about the data the model was trained on
  - Uncommon (or poorly documented) libraries -> uncertain results

- Probabilistic nature
  - Asking the same thing twice may lead to different answers

- **REVIEW**
  - Read the code and understand what it is doing BEFORE running it

- <u>Version control</u>
  - Iterative revisions will often break your code; ensure you can go back if needed

---

# Responsible Use Workflow

- Check against docs for a second opinion
  - There may already be a recommended way to solve a problem

- Always use tests, linters, CI pipelines to check correctness
  - Check against your requirements, an LLM doesn't understand the environment outside its own context

- Record provenance
  - Prompts, outputs and decisions should be recorded

- **RESPONSIBILITY REMAINS WITH YOU**
